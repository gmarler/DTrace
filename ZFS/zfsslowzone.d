 * zfsslowzone.d	Trace slow ZFS/VFS reads and writes.
 *
 * USAGE:	zfsslowzone.d min_ms
 *    eg,
 *		zfsslowzone.d 50	# show I/O longer than 50 ms
 *
 * This traces at the VFS layer, so the latency shown is directly suffered
 * by the application.  The output is wide (sorry).  This script is based
 * on zfsslower.d from the DTrace book.
